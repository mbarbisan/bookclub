| The Premonition: A Pandemic Story | Michael Lewis | This a book about pandemics. First about how the US Government prepared for pandemics, and then about how it responded when the COVID pandemic struck. While this won't really tell you much about specific leadership techniques, I found the stories about individuals demonstrating leadership in the face of systemic failure to be quite inspiring. It also reinforced to me how important it is to push back against the 'logic' of the system, and to support the individuals we lead. |
