| Title | Author | Notes | 
| ----- | ------ | ----- | 
| The Premonition: A Pandemic Story | Michael Lewis | This a book about pandemics. First about how the US Government prepared for pandemics, and then about how it responded when the COVID pandemic struck. While this won't really tell you much about specific leadership techniques, I found the stories about individuals demonstrating leadership in the face of systemic failure to be quite inspiring. It also reinforced to me how important it is to push back against the 'logic' of the system, and to support the individuals we lead. |
| Turn the Ship Around: A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders | L. David Marquet | Required reading. A story about trusting and enabling the people you lead. |
| Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action | Simon Sinek | How leaders should communicate. I fail at this often. | 
| Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It | Chris Voss | Negotiate like an FBI hostage negotiator. This is the book that inspired me to move towards Engineering Leadership. I view this as a book about 'hacking' people through language. |

### Books

| Title | Author | Notes |

| An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management | Will Larson | I get the feeling that most of the content of this book is from blog posts from [Wil Larson's blog](https://lethain.com/). So if you're willing to dig in his archive, you can get most of the content of this book. Still, the content is fantastic. I found the book covered a lot of what we do as Engineering Leaders (managers, directors, etc.) and it sparked a lot of ideas for different approaches to what we do. Highly recommended! |
| User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product  | Jeff Patton | Learn about how to run story mapping sessions |
